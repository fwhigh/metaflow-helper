## Quickstart

You can run the model selection tournament immediately like this. 
Install a convenience package called metaflow-helper.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/fwhigh/metaflow-helper.git
cd metaflow-helper
python -m pip install .
```

Then run a Metaflow example. 
Examples need a few more packages, including Metaflow itself, which metaflow-helper doesnâ€™t currently require.

```bash
python -m pip install -r example-requirements.txt
python examples/model-selection/train.py run
```

You can visualize the example flow.

```bash
python examples/model-selection/train.py output-dot | dot -Grankdir=TB -Tpng -o model-selection-flow.png
```
